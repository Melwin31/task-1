Real-time Validation

onkeyup event ensures validation occurs as the user types.
The JavaScript function validateForm() checks each input field.
Error messages are displayed next to invalid fields.
Disabling the Submit Button

The submit button is disabled initially.
It is only enabled when all inputs are valid.
Preventing Default Form Submission

For demonstration, the form does not actually submit data.
Instead, an alert message confirms validation success.
This implementation provides a clean and user-friendly validation experience.
